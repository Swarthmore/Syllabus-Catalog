		Course Description
		</p>
		<p>        We have been witnesses to – and participants in – a literary event.  Despite age differences, we are all part of the Harry Potter generation. We have grown up with Harry and watched Harry grow up, and no other generation of readers will experience his serial saga as we have.  What made Harry’s story so compelling?  This seminar will give us the opportunity to examine this beloved chronicle in a new light, and, I hope, in greater depth.  We will look at how J. K. Rowling tapped into the mythic hero’s journey and how her retelling of that tale relates to previous tellings of the mythic story through the centuries and across cultures.  We will examine writers on myth and the psyche, such as Carl Jung, and Joseph Campbell, and explore both classical and contemporary tales of heroes and heroines, their battles against evil, and their quests for transcendence and wisdom.  Our purpose is to try to understand why we are driven to invent stories about battling inhuman powers to learn what it means to be human.  
		</p>
		<p>        The reading list for this course is daunting, since we will be examining a number of epic works.  I can only justify the amount of required reading by assuring myself that anyone who signed up for the class has already read all seven volumes of the Harry Potter series.  I am also assuming that most of you are very familiar with Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, either through the books (perhaps even read several times) or the Peter Jackson film version, and that therefore I can assign selections from this trilogy and count on your following where these chapters fit into the overall arc of the story.  (Of course, you are always welcome to read more than I have assigned.)  If you know the story through the films only, please be aware that the film differs from Tolkien’s plot in numerous and significant ways. A number of you may even be familiar already with the works by Pullman and by Nix.  That is wonderful.  All the better to turn to closer readings of these books.  Our required reading assignments begin slowly and then accelerate almost alarmingly, so I can’t urge you strongly enough to get a head start.  Most of the assigned readings are page turners and great fun; use them for relaxing and entertainment, but read them thoroughly.  
		</p>
		<p>        The structure of the seminar is cumulative, by which I mean that each discussion will not focus only on the assigned reading, but will refer to all the readings that have come before.  The topics for each class are meant as touchstones for issues crucial to our understanding of the hero/heroine’s quest and as points of departure for our discussions.  They are not meant to be limiting.  So, for example, while we are scheduled to discuss Mother Figures in relation to The Odyssey, that does not mean we will not discuss them again when we talk about His Dark Materials.  Nor does that mean we will not refer to “The Scouring of the Shire,”  when we are reading Tolkien even though the topic, “Repairing the World” doesn’t occur until we are reading Nix.  Since our topic is vast and ambitious, flexibility will be required.
		</p>

		<p>Requirements
		        
		</p><p>        Despite how much we will have to discuss, we must keep in mind that this seminar is a writing seminar.  We will use a fair amount of our time talking about writing strategy, structure, and style, responding to each other’s work, and learning how to edit one’s self.  My purpose in choosing this topic for an FYS is to give you a subject you are passionate about on which to focus your writing.  Academic writing can be passionate! – but it must be well structured and well supported.  You need to develop your abilities not only to write clearly and succinctly, but also to write material worth reading.  
		</p>
		<p>        There will be four written assignments.  The first will be a very short essay responding to a critical review of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  The purpose of this work is to give me a sense of the state of your writing abilities.  It will not be graded (except in the event it is turned in late or not at all) and shouldn’t be the cause of anxiety.  The remaining essays will be discussed further at a later date, but all will involve comparing texts to other texts, criticism, or other outside reading.  There will be opportunities to include multicultural quests.  
		</p>
		<p>        Assignments are due by e-mail as stated on the syllabus.  Extensions will be granted rarely, and only when requested before the due date.  A late paper will receive a one-third letter grade deduction for each day it is late. (B+ to a B, B to B-, B- to C+, etc.) A conference will be required after the second essay to discuss any writing concerns either you or I have and to offer guidance for a revision if necessary.  Revision is a wonderful writing aid (haven’t you already been told that all good writing is rewriting?) and I wish we had more time to work it into this class, but individual rewrites are encouraged and can be submitted to improve one’s essay grade.  If you wish to rewrite an essay, please discuss it with me. (To be safe, always keep a hard copy of your submitted assignment.)
		</p>
		<p>        Remember, plagiarism is intellectual theft.  I am interested in helping you develop your ideas and your moral sense of when your ideas are indebted to others.  It is your responsibility to ensure that all your citations are properly credited.  These include indirect as well as direct quotations and references, websites, etc.  Please consult <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/english/plagiarism.htm">http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/english/plagiarism.htm</a>  for complete information on correct forms of citation and the consequences of plagiarism at Swarthmore.
		</p><p>        Class attendance and participation are required.  This class is a seminar, not a lecture, and the give and take of our community of scholars is at its core.  We will all be learning from each other and this is not possible without regular attendance and a respectful give and take of ideas.  Unexcused absences will result in a grade deduction.
		</p>


		<p>Grading
		</p><p>        Your grades will be a composite of your class participation, writing assignments and final exam to be weighted as follows:  
		</p>
		<p>                Writing assignments:
		</p><p>                        Second essay    15%
		</p><p>                        Third essay     15%
		</p><p>                        Fourth essay    20%
		</p>                
		<p>                Class participation:    35%
		</p>
		<p>                Final Exam:             15%
		</p><hr/>

		<p>                Total:                     100%
